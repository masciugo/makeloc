Description:
    A little generator to tidy locale files along with their content for Ruby On Rails

Example:
    rails g makeloc:do it config/locales/activerecord.en.yml [--strict]

    This will create:
        config/locales/activerecord.it.yml
        
    with option --strict it overwrites (if already present) the generated locale file deleting its original extra translations
